Done for just 30 minutes a day, 5 times a week, improvements in Alzheimer’s patients have been observed. It is currently being done in 1,400 care homes with 15,000 Alzheimer's patients all over Japan and has had great success. Many individuals showed improvements in communication and behavior.

Through persistent practice one strives to achieve a state of selflessness, increased insight, inner purity, balance- true health and ultimately enlightenment. Since July 1999 the communist government of China has persecuted and enslaved millions of innocent people for practicing Falun Dafa and they comprise 65% of labor camps, detention centers and prisons across China for believing in Truth- Compassion- Forbearance. Evidence from acclaimed sources have proven tens of thousands of Falun Dafa practitioners to have been killed from live organ harvesting for China’s lucrative organ transplant market. So what do we, as an organization, do on campus? We meditate together and teach the exercises, promote cultural art events that revive traditional Chinese culture and raise awareness about the persecution and organ harvesting of Falun Dafa practitioners in China.",

We are open to all levels, leading to a very diverse group of skaters and students. \r\n\r\nOur competitive team competes in the USFSA Intercollegiate circuit throughout the school year. Our primary goals is to qualify for Intercollegiate Nationals hosted at the end of each season. Each skater performs individually in events of their choosing (in their corresponding level). The points they earn from podium placement get added to the UCSD cumulative team score which goes towards rankings. The top four teams per section are invited to Nationals at the end of the season, and we have qualified the last 3 years in a row! Intercollegiate competitions are a great place to have fun and bond as a team as well as getting to network with like-minded skaters and students from all over the nation. \r\n\r\nCompeting, while fun, is not a requirement. Our team is also open to anyone who loves figure skating! We host different social events throughout the year for skating enthusiasts and skaters alike - watch parties, skating night, and of course dessert trips. With many of our members being long time skaters and some even being professional coaches, it's a great networking opportunity for people who have never skated before but would love to give it a try! \r\n\r\nOur team is tight knit on and off the ice. Practices are largely self scheduled as figure skating is a sport driven by individual motivation to improve. However, members often carpool to practice help one another with jumps, spins, and choreography. Figure Skating at UCSD is open to anyone who loves the ice, and whether you've been competing your whole life or you've never put on a pair of skates before, this team has a place for you.",

Tijuana is facing several public health crises,  including an HIV epidemic, elevated rates of drug addiction (compared to  the national average), issues associated with a large homeless  population, and an influx of Haitian refugees. These crises have been  driven in part by US deportation and immigration policies, lack of local  resources, police brutality, and a refusal to deal with these issues by the  city government. \r\n\r\n• Fronteras Saludables (Healthier Borders) will support the efforts of the  HFiT free clinic through fundraising for medical supplies,  \r\nmedications, and other equipment. Health Frontiers in Tijuana (HFiT) is  a student-run free clinic established in Tijuana, Mexico. HFiT was  founded as a partnership between UCSD's School of Medicine and  Tijuana’s Autonomous University of Baja California School of Medicine  (UABC), the only publicly funded medical school in Tijuana, in 2011. Since  then, HFiT continues to serve vulnerable populations, including substance  users, sex workers, the homeless, deportees, and indigent patients. \r\n\r\n• Fronteras Saludables (Healthier Borders) will inform UCSD  undergraduates about opportunities to get involved through the HFIT  internship program and other supporting roles. Current HFIT interns  who want to be part of the student organization will share their  experiences with new members. Motivated students who want to join the internship program (HFiT-UIP) and/or want to provide assistance outside  of the clinic will be given information on how to apply and how to take leadership roles in fundraising and public health efforts.",

        "Academic Year": "2024",
        "Purpose": "To provide a space where students can engage in, and share, creative writing. Carrying with it a focus on catering to the needs of more introverted students and general lovers of poetry as a written art form, not necessarily a spoken art form. For example, the club allows students the option, if they wish, to share their writing anonymously.  \r\n\r\nPoetry clubs and literature clubs have historically had a very social focus in that they've revolved around the public speaking aspect of creative written word. This facet of modern literature clubs is a reflection of the origins of the art form, in that they tend to focus on performative art. Here, that is not the case. \r\n\r\nWe hold that poetry is a window into the soul, that it is extremely personal, and that it is very difficult for a largely untapped group of  literature lovers, who, while they may have quite a few things they would benefit from expressing, struggle to share those expressions in any way that leaves them vulnerable or pressures them to engage in public speaking. \r\n\r\nWe instead have a welcoming space that provides access to the tools, resources, and encouragement, to put pen to paper and make that inner voice heard In a way that focuses on the written aspect itself, as well as the raw emotion that fuels it.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, we want to prepare and encourage students to work toward the annual Muir poetry award, to hold writing workshops and help students learn to better express themselves, and ultimately to create a close knit community that encourages people who've perhaps never even had the chance to write like this before, to do so. \r\n\r\nUCSD is largely a STEM focused university. It is because the standard academic life is expected to be so cold and calculated that we feel many students have had such little opportunity to express themselves in a creative way that's free from academic scrutiny. We hold that there needs to be a space that brings together those who wish to have a little more creative freedom in their life. A place separate from regular academic curriculum that gives them a place to feel, express, and share, in a way that's completely free of ridicule and any pressure whatsoever.",

We are united in our belief that capitalism—a system where all wealth and power is held by a small group of billionaires and their state—is the source of the main problems confronting humanity today. It must be replaced by socialism, a system where poor and working people control all the wealth and power of society, using it to plan for and meet the needs of the people and planet.",

The club will be spilt into two teams. Team A which is a high intensity level activity and competitive. Then Team B will be more social and laid back for college students who want less commitment but still want to be part of a community of basketball players. Since there is no women’s basketball club, women college student’s on campus will have an easier time finding a community of women who play basketball. This club is being created as a first step in order to become recognized as a UCSD Sports Club by UC San Diego Recreation.",

Our goal is to bring light to this significant yet overlooked issue and take a proactive role in sparking meaningful change in this area. The geological proximity of this crisis coupled with the decline in wildlife and drastic reduction of once-thriving kelp forests have taken a severe toll on the ecosystem. This has turned a once clean and prosperous ecosystem into a polluted and unsuitable habitat for many organisms. Therefore, our mission aims to return this ecosystem to its former glory by bringing these issues to public attention, highlighting and advocating for urgent action. By engaging and uniting the community under this cause, we will grow the demand for government attention and funding, beginning the push for meaningful changes, shaping the water quality of tomorrow every step of the way.",
